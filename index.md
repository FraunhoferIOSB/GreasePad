## Frequently Asked Questions

### Interaction

*Q. Given a scene with segments and constraints, how do I select individual segments and/or constraints?*

A. With a computer mouse as pointing device, you can select segments or constraints using the mouse's right button. With a stylus or one of your fingers, you will probably have to press for a short moment onto the touch pad. If a graphicsal element covers another element, you can change the visual stacking.
