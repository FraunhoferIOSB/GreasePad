# GreasePad 1.2.0

The *GreasePad* provides a drawing area and expects pen strokes as the only user input. These strokes are approximated by straight line segments leading to line drawings. During this interactive process, geometric relations such as orthogonality are recognized and enforced immediately by an adjustment process. The program can be utilized to study systems of straight lines and constraints (closure theorems) or to outline the shapes of human-made objects in images. As a pointing device, you can use a computer mouse, a stylus, or one of your fingers in combination with a touchscreen.

## News
* Version 1.2.0 (Oct. 2023): The additional, specific constraints *horizontal*, *vertical*, and *diagonal* enable the alignment of segments with the frame of the canvas. These constraints are disable be default, i.e., they have to be activated by selecting the corresponding menu item.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Interaction

*Q. Given a scene with segments and constraints, how do I select individual segments and/or constraints?*

A. With a computer mouse as pointing device, you can select segments or constraints using the mouse's right button. With a stylus or one of your fingers, you will probably have to press for a short moment onto the touch pad. If a graphical element covers another element, you can change the visual stacking.
